# Task-Monitor
Simple lightweight CLI task monitor in Python 3. Prob better than task manager on Win or activity monitor on Mac since its more lightweight unless if you need to look in advance (e.g. running apps, threads)

I will keep working on this

# Requirements & Third Party Modules

Requirements:
- Python 3.10 at least installed on your system and on your path

Third Party Modules:
- psutil
- GPUtil
- colorama

# Installation

**1. Just clone this repo:**
        git clone https://github.com/Anz1x/Task-Monitor/
        
**2 Run the program (it will automatically install all the required modules if u dont have it):**
        python3 main.py    
        
**OPTIONAL if u want u can set an alias for this and its highly recommended since it will be much easier to run it**
